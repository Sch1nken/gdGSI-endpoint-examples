# gdGSI Example Endpoints

## What is this?

These are some example endpoint implementations for [gdGSI](https://github.com/Sch1nken/gdGSI)

## Naming Convention

Please don't get confused by the naming convention here.
`http_client` is referring to when the GSI is in `http_client`-Mode. So it is always referring to the GSI instance.

Same for `websocket_client` (the GSI instance is the client, the script will start up a server) and `websocket_server` (the GSI instance will act as the server and the provided script will connect to it).
